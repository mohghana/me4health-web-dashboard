End User Training and Support
================================

This set of documentation describes the initial and follow up workshops that Digital Campus has used (in Ethiopia) for getting users set up and running with Android phones and using OppiaMobile.

We've used this workshop structure many times, and have found it works well, but please feel free to adapt to your and your users needs.
