Session 8: How to use ODK for PNC & ANC checklists when visiting outreach patients
(Time: 90 min)
Objectives
To understand how to use ODK for checklists when doing a PNC or ANC visit
Activities
Explain how ODK works: Actual training on the use of the Android with ODK for data collection is pretty straightforward. Do every step multiple times, and have the students hold up their phones and show you the results. People don't ask questions if they don't have to, so interject yourself into their operation and help them on an individual level. It helps to have more than one teacher in the room.
Exercise 1: Self-Interview. The  students read the questions out loud to themselves and record the answers. It's better than sharing interviews, because when you pair up in groups of two, you are really only training half of them. Half of them are just answering questions.
Exercise 2: Paired Interviews. Let the enumerators pair up in groups of two. They can interview each other. Sometimes, they can do alternating questions, switching back and forth. Most of the time, one of them should complete an entire survey as the interviewer, and then they should switch roles.
Exercise 4: Almost the Real thing. Duplicate all the conditions of a real field survey, but in an area that doesn't fit in your sampling. Let the students go out into the health centre on their own, choose people to interview, and complete several interviews. This is the test of fire. Other than this being fake data, everything else should be just like the real survey will be.Review the data from this exercise well. Look for things like the start and end times of the surveys. Are they so short that it might be fake? Look at the time between surveys. Is there enough time to do proper sampling?.  How do you know if your student found a nice spot to sit down and completed a couple interviews without actually talking to anyone?. Check the data to be sure they are answering all the questions.
It's a good idea after this exercise to ask everyone to share their experience in class together. Some common problems will pop up, like failure of the subject to understand the questions etc... This is when people realize for the first time that working in the field is not like practice.
Encourage peer support - if there are strong participants who pick up the functions quickly - ask them to help any participants who may be struggling.
M&E
Complete register sheet (if being run on different day to the other sessions)
Complete the competency checklist for each of the functions listed in the objective

ODK Installation guidelines 

Install the current Digital- Campus ODKversion
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.digitalcampus.odk.collect
Place the icon on the desktop
Remove all non-relevant icons and widgets.
Set the keyboard to be Touch Input and change the settings to remove all suggestions and spell checking. Turn off vibrate, turn on sound.
Copy the current surveys to /sdcard/odk/forms 
Load the form the first time to make sure it's loaded, it's valid, and save time later. It loads much faster the second time.
