Using GitHub
============

All the OppiaMobile source code (for all components) is hosted on `GitHub 
<http://github.com>`_. So before starting to make any customisations you should
make yourself familiar with how git works and create your own account on GitHub
(for free).

The key advantages to using a versioning system like GitHub include:

* Good tracking of what changes have been made, when and by whom
* Built in bug and issue tracker
* Ability for others to easily take a copy (fork) of the code for their own use
  and keep this up to date with new features and developments in the core 
  version.
  
You will find it extremely beneficial to create a proper ``fork`` of the code 
for the various OppiaMobile components rather than just taking a basic copy of 
the code, since a fork will allow you to easily merge in future developments,
updates and bug fixes as well as submitting fixes and new features back into the 
core version for anyone else to take advantage of.

Submitting changes to the core version
---------------------------------------

If you have made updates (new functionality, bug fixes etc) that you'd like to 
contribute back to the core version of OppiaMobile, then please issue a "pull 
request".

You can find info here on how to issue a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

Creating small, specific pull requests (matched to an issue in GitHub issue 
tracker), will make it much easier and quicker (and also more likely) that your 
changes can be incorporated into the core version.

We're keen to acknowledge those who have contributed to the development of 
OppiaMobile, so please also send us your attribution information (name, 
organisation etc), so we can include you in the about/acknowledgements section 
of the app.
